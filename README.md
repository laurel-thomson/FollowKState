# Follow K-State

This is an Android application created by myself and other members of the K-State Mobile Development Club for the 2018 Spring Showcase.
The app allows users to view tweets from Twitter accounts affiliated with Kansas State University. Users can select which accounts they would like to view tweets from. The tweets are sorted by recency and number of likes and retweets.

Download the app from the Google Play Store <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=laurel.beth.thomson.followkstate">
